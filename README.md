# CS3700 - Introduction to Database Systems

## Course Description

This repository contains assignments completed for **CS3700: Introduction to Database Systems**. The course provides a comprehensive introduction to the foundational concepts, models, and techniques used in modern database systems, with a focus on the relational model and practical implementation using SQL.

## Topics Covered

- General introduction to database systems and DBMS distinction
- Data models: Entity-Relationship (E/R), relational, network, and object-oriented models
- Three-schema architecture and database design methodologies
- E/R diagrams, conceptual and logical modeling
- Relational algebra and relational calculus
- SQL: Data definition, manipulation, queries, and advanced features
- Database schema design, normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, 4NF, 5NF)
- Data storage, file organization, and indexing (B+ trees, hash-based structures)
- Transaction processing, ACID properties, concurrency control, and recovery
- Introduction to NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB)
- Practical database application development and administration

## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of the course, you will be able to:

- Explain program-data independence, data models, and the distinction between database schema and instances
- Apply relational algebra and translate queries accordingly
- Write and optimize SQL statements for database creation, manipulation, and querying
- Design conceptual models using the E/R approach and convert them to relational schemas
- Analyze and normalize database schemas to various normal forms
- Understand and implement indexing, transaction management, and recovery mechanisms
- Compare and contrast RDBMS, OODBMS, and ORDBMS approaches
- Develop and evaluate real-world database applications using a DBMS
